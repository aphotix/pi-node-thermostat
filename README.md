pi-node-thermostat
=================
# requirements
* Node 6.x or greater -- I recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md#install-script)
* A raspberry Pi
* A 16x2 Display (or a better display if you are motivated.) I am using one from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1115)
* a relay or relays for each device controlled (I will evaluate controlling a wifi socket, although I have anxiety about how secure these devices are. I might explore building an arduino/wifi powered socket or some other wirelessly controlled relay)
* A temperature sensor (I like the SHT31)
* A sense of adventure.
